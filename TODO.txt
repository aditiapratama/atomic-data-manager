Key:
+ = new feature
* = change feature
- = fix bug



High Priority:
+ Add a pie menu to quickly Nuke or Clean specific datablocks

Low Priority:
+ Add detection and a warning for missing files


Completed Tasks:
- Fix bug where the particle inspector lists all objects instead of the ones that use the particle system (5/13/19)
+ See data you're about to delete before you delete it when using Nuke and Clean operators (5/28/19)
* Find a more obvious way to implement inspection buttons (5/28/19)
+ Add search bar support to quickly Nuke or Clean specific datablocks (5/28/19)

Not Fixing:
- Nuking in some project files causes Blender to crash (freak chance crash)
- Undo does not work after removing specific data-blocks (issue with Blender, not the add-on -- works now!)
- Deleting particle systems that are applied to an object will delete the object as well (particle systems require
  particle settings -- they can't be deleted separately)
* Find a better location for deleting individual objects (it's fine where it is)
* Make less useful features less prominent (e.g. pin, duplicate, rename) (they're fine where they are)
