Key:
+ = new feature
* = change feature
- = fix bug


High Priority:
* Fix bug where objects with particle systems are not detected
* Find an alternative for empty spots in statistics
+ Implement search and replace operations for missing file detections

Low Priority:
+ Add support for removing libraries for missing file recovery
+ Add a feature that allows the user to rename all "unnamed" objects at once
* Find a way to position missing file warnings in the center of the screen


Completed Tasks:
- Fix bug where the particle inspector lists all objects instead of the ones that use the particle system (5/13/19)
+ See data you're about to delete before you delete it when using Nuke and Clean operators (5/28/19)
* Find a more obvious way to implement inspection buttons (5/28/19)
+ Add search bar support to quickly Nuke or Clean specific data-blocks (5/28/19)
+ Add a pie menu to quickly Nuke or Clean specific data-blocks (5/29/19)
+ Add "Nuke All" and "Clean All" functions to the pie menu (6/3/19)
+ Add detection for missing files (6/3/19)
+ Add a warning on file open for missing files (6/3/19)
- Prevent warnings from appearing on startup (6/3/19)
- Remove extra particle system statistics (6/5/19)
+ Add detection for missing libraries (links) (6/6/19)
+ Add addon preferences(6/6/19)
+ Add and implement a full set of add-on preferences (7/9/19)
+ Add support for CG Cookie's add-on updater (7/9/19)

Not Fixing:
- Nuking in some project files causes Blender to crash (freak chance crash)
- Undo does not work after removing specific data-blocks (issue with Blender, not the add-on -- works now!)
- Deleting particle systems that are applied to an object will delete the object as well (particle systems require
  particle settings -- they can't be deleted separately)
* Find a better location for deleting individual objects (it's fine where it is)
* Make less useful features less prominent (e.g. pin, duplicate, rename) (they're fine where they are)
* Find a better implementation for images size (not do-able with the way Blender stores images)
+ Add a button to launch detection for missing files (not necessary while working with a file)
