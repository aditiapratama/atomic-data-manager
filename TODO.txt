Key:
+ = new feature
* = change feature
- = fix bug

High Priority:
+ See data you're about to delete before you delete it when using Nuke and Clean operators
- Fix bug where nuking in some project files causes Blender to crash
- Fix bug where undo does not work after removing specific data-blocks
- Fix bug where deleting particle systems on an object deletes the object as well

Low Priority:
+ Add search bar support to quickly Nuke or Clean datablocks
+ Add a pie menu to quickly Nuke or Clean datablocks
+ Add detection and a warning for missing files
* Find a better location for deleting individual objects
* Find a more obvious way to implement inspection buttons (magnifying glass button following icon-ed toggle button?)
* Make less useful features (e.g. pin, duplicate, rename) less prominent

Completed Tasks:
- Fix bug where the particle inspector lists all objects instead of the ones that actually use the particle system
